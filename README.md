## üîó Blockchain Technology Integration

Space Puzzle leverages Core blockchain technology in several innovative ways:

### Smart Contract Functionality

- **Player Data Storage**: All player statistics (score, level, keys, badges) are stored in the `SpacePuzzleGame` smart contract.
- **Badge Minting**: Achievements are represented as ERC721 NFTs and mintable.
- **Daily Rewards**: The contract enforces a cooldown period for claiming daily points.

- **Leaderboard Tracking**: Top 10 global scores are tracked and maintained on-chain.

### Network Support

- **Core Testnet**: For development and testing (Chain ID 1114)
- **Core Mainnet**: For production gameplay (Chain ID 1116)
- **Testnet Faucet**: Request test tokens directly from the application's UI when connected to testnet.

### Web3 Integration

- **Wallet Connection**: Seamlessly connect your Web3 wallet to play and track progress.
- **Transaction Management**: Game-critical actions (saving progress, claiming rewards) are processed as blockchain transactions.
- **Network Detection**: Automatic detection of the connected network with helpful guidance.
