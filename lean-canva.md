# 🚀 Lean Canvas Model: Space Puzzle Game

## 🛠️ Problem

Traditional puzzle games struggle to maintain long-term engagement and offer tangible rewards for achievements. In contrast, many Web3 games prioritize earning over gameplay, leading to short-term player retention and a speculative user base. As a result, players often lack meaningful incentives, and there is no economic model that effectively rewards time and skill investment.

## 💡 Solution

**Key features:**
- NFT achievement badges (ERC-721) with rarity tiers, tradable in open markets  
- Daily rewards and leaderboard incentives  
- Smart contract logic on Core Blockchain  
- Blockchain-backed storage of progress and achievements  
- Seamless cross-device compatibility  

The game merges engaging gameplay with meaningful rewards to drive long-term player retention.
